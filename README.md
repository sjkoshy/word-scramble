# Word Scramble

## A front-end game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
 
1. A scrambled word will appear, randomized from an array of words.
2. User will input their guess in the textbox and click Check Word.
3. A pop-up will appear indicating if the guess was correct or not.
5. The div containing the scrambled word will then display the next word.
6. For each correct guess, the score count will increase by 10 points. If the user reaches 100 points, they have won the game.

## Next Sprints / Improvements

1. Use a Random Word Generator API to populate the word array.
2. Use innerText to display game status messages, instead of an alert pop-up in the browser.
3. Use DOM property body.style.background to alternate red & green for correct & incorrect guesses.
